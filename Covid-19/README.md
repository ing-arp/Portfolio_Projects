# COVID-19 DASHBOARD

This is a dashboard created with Power BI with information about COVID-19. It includes data (automatically retrieved from web sites in each update of the information) on Cases, Deaths and Vaccinations, as well as some indices on Deaths and Vaccinations based on the Population.
Charts can be viewed on a daily or weekly basis, and filters based on countries and regions can be applied.
