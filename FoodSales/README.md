# FOODSALES POJECT

This is a project based on a fictitious company that I have called "FoodSales", which sells food products. Using the data from the sales orders, I have created a dashboard in PowerBI, as well as some queries in SQL to obtain various data and calculations.

1. PowerBI

The dashboard has 3 sections:
* A home page that presents a summary of the main indicators, and has the buttons to access the different sections.
* A revenue page where the main indicators (Revenue, Order, ATP) are summarized, evaluated against the Budget and grouped by various categories. In the graphs of "Revenue vs. Budget" and "Revenue by Product Group" pop-up windows are displayed with additional information when sliding the cursor over the graphs. A filter page can be activated to filter the information based on "Year", "Product Category", "Manager", "Supervisor" and "Salesperson".
* A page dedicated to analyzing the performance of sellers, which presents a ranking of sellers (with the main associated KPIs) based on the time filter applied.

2. SQL

Some queries developed in SQL are presented, used to answer various business questions. Each question is written in the code and then the code to answer it.
There have been used:
* Joins
* Aggregation functions
* CTEs
* Views
* Procedures
